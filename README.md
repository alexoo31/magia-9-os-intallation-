# OSSP Project ‚Äì Mageia Linux & `vfork()` System Call

## A. Mageia OS Installation  
Mageia 9 was installed in a virtual machine using Balena Etcher and VirtualBox. The setup involved flashing the ISO, selecting the desktop environment, setting a root password, and enabling the firewall. Mageia‚Äôs ext4 filesystem offers stability and performance. The installation was smooth and user-friendly.

## B. `vfork()` System Call Implementation  
The `vfork()` system call was implemented to demonstrate lightweight process creation. Unlike `fork()`, it allows the child to share memory with the parent until `exec()` or `_exit()` is called. This makes it faster for launching new programs. It‚Äôs ideal for constrained environments and efficient process management.
